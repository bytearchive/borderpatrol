/**
 * After some investigation into prototyping and fast ciphers, I have a few observations and an implementation
 * Observations:
 *   - It's clear that ChaCha and AES are winners in the speed category of ciphers
 *     (http://bench.cr.yp.to/results-stream.html)
 *   - Stream ciphers are probably the wrong use-case here because we most likely want authenticated encryption, which
 *     rules out ChaCha.
 *   - Most block ciphers require an IV (which must be unique, but can be predictable) *
 *   - AES-GCM is an authenticated encryption mechanism that could be very useful here *
 *
 * Implementation Details:
 *   I have chosen to make the IV be the SignedId.Entropy, since it is unique but predictable and public. The key
 *   then becomes the hashed SecretKey which is private.
 *
 *   CryptKey := AES-GCM( Key , Iv )
 *   Key := PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1( SecretKey )
 *   Iv := SignedId.Entropy
 *
 * This means that all sessions will be encrypted with the same secret, but they will have a unique IV based on the
 * entropy of the session id. Note: secrets are rotated daily.
 *
 * Alternatively, you could create a new SignedId every time Session data is stored
